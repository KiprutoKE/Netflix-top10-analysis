# Netflix-top10-analysis
The end goal was to analyze the relationship between the runtime of shows and their weekly rank by merging two datasets and visualizing the results. Specifically, we aimed to:

Load Data: Import data from two CSV files containing information about the top 10 shows globally and in specific countries.
Merge Data: Combine the two datasets on common columns (show_title, category, and weekly_rank) to create a unified DataFrame.
Visualize Data: Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the runtime of shows (runtime_global) and their weekly rank, with different colors representing different categories.
Calculate Correlation: Compute and print the correlation between the runtime of shows and their weekly rank to understand the strength and direction of the relationship.
By achieving these steps, we can gain insights into how the duration of content might influence its popularity and ranking on a weekly basis.
